# bitelp
## The bitelp is a small kernel, and the whole project will not be finished before 2020. Now I have just finished a very little work,and more features will be added into it. I open this repo aimed for recording the process which I think will be meaningful. The first three three words of this name stands for BIT, which is my university. The following three word that I named "elp" is just the abbreviation of "help", because bithelp doesn't sounds good, so I use bitelp as the name of my kernel instead of using bithelp.
